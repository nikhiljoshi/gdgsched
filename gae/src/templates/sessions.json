In this talk, we'll first briefly look at these three tagging technologies comparing and contrasting them in order to understand their respective use-case based on our experience deploying such solutions in the real-world.\n\nWe will then wear our Android hat and look at how much of a fantastic Web of Things platform Android truly is!
